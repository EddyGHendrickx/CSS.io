#### H4 You can always count on me when
you're facing any problem, and I'm not too busy. :)

##### H5 A funny Story
I bought my first car for â‚¬150 because
the orignal owner wanted to return it to
the scrap metal yard. I bought it for the same
price and that's why I got it so cheap.
My dad bought me a GPS system for the same
car, which cost 600 euro, so the GPS in my
car has more value than my car itself.

###### H6 TL;DR
My GPS device in my car is worth more
than my car itself.
